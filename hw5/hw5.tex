        \item Exercise 2.8
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item We know that $\overline{g}$ is the average function of many different hypothesis $g_1,\ g_2,...,\ g_n$ of different data sets. $H$ represents the hypotheses set, where each hypothesis in $H$ is dependent on their respective data set. If the hypothesis in $H$ are in linear combination, then the average of the hypotheses in $H$ should also be a linear combination, proving that $\overline{g} \in H \hfill \blacksquare$
            \item We can imagine a model with two hypotheses, one that will label all datapoints as $+1$ and another as $-1$, then the average of those two hypotheses will be $0$, which is not in the hypothesis set, therefore $\overline{g} \notin H \hfill \blacksquare$
            \item (b) is a binary classification and $\overline{g}$ is not a binary function since $0 \notin \{+1, -1\}$. Often, with more hypotheses, the average will be a number between $\{-1, 1\}$, it will be unlikely that they are $+1$ or $-1$
        \end{enumerate}

        \item Problem 2.14
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Given that the $d_{vc}$ is finite, we know that the hypothesis can shatter any data set of size $d_{vc}$. We can claim that $K(d_{vc}) \geq d_{vc}(H)$, since $K(d_{vc})$ assumes that every $K$ hypothesis can shatter the maximum number of points, $d_{vc}$. Then $K(d_{vc} + 1) > K(d_{vc}) \geq d_{vc}(H)$, by transitivity, $K(d_{vc} + 1) > d_{vc}(H) \hfill \blacksquare$
            \item Given that the hypothesis has a finite VC dimension, then we have a breakpoint such that $2^\ell > \ell^{d_{vc}} + 1$ If we have $K$ hypotheses, then $m_H(\ell) \leq K(\ell^{d_{vc}}+1)$. By inspection, $2K\ell^{d_{vc}} > K(\ell^{d_{vc}} + 1)$. So here we know that $2^\ell > 2K\ell d^{vc} > K(\ell ^{d_{vc}} + 1)$, by transitivity, $2^\ell > K(\ell ^{d_{vc}} + 1)$, which means $2^\ell > m_H(\ell)$, if this is true, then it means that there are no hypothesis can shatter $2^\ell$ points, which means that $d_{vc} \leq \ell \hfill \blacksquare$
